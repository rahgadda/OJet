## Typescript

### Overview

- TypeScript is a typed super set of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

  ![](../01-Images/05-Typescript.png)

- TypeScript is pure object oriented with classes, interfaces and statically typed like C# or Java.
- Compiled TypeScript can be consumed from any JavaScript code.
- Typescript provides [playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/) to run and test. The online editor shows the corresponding JavaScript emitted by the compiler.
- Typescript compiler rejects any raw JavaScript file passed to it. The compiler deals with only **.ts** or **.d.ts** files.

---

### Architecture

- It was designed by **Anders Hejlsberg** (designer of C#) at Microsoft.
- TypeScript comes with an optional static typing and type inference system through the TLS (TypeScript Language Service).
- Typescript uses features like Modules, classes inline to EcmaScript specifications. Typescript also adds additional features like generics and type annotations that arenâ€™t a part of the EcmaScript.
- JavaScript is an interpreted language. Identification of errors can be done based on code execution. Unlike JavaScript, Typescript transpiler provides the error-checking feature. TypeScript will compile the code and generate compilation errors, if it finds some sort of syntax errors.
- TypeScript supports type definitions for existing JavaScript libraries. TypeScript Definition file (with **.d.ts** extension) provides definition for external JavaScript libraries.

### Installation

- Install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org)
- Install typescript using `npm i -g typescript`. During this tutorial typescript version was **v3.6**.
- To convert a file from **.ts** to **.js** run `tsc <file.ts>`
  ![](../01-Images/06-Compilation.png)
- Typescript has good support for VSCode. Compilation options of typescript can be provided using `tsconfig.json`. A default file can be created using `tsc --init`.
- The `tsconfig.json` file should be placed at the root of TypeScript project so that it be directly used by tsc compiler.
- To run node.js modules code in typescript install `npm install -g ts-node`.

  ```typescript

  // main.ts
  console.log("Hello world");

  ts-node main.ts
  ```

### Modules

- #### Data Types:

  - During variable declaration it is mandatory to define datatype of variables in Typescript.

  ```typescript
  var num: number =5;
  num = "Sample" \\ This leads to Error

  ```

  - Typescript allows to support more than one datatype to a variable. This is called **union type definition**.

  ```typescript
  let code: string | number;
  code = 123; // OK
  code = "ABC"; // OK
  code = false; // Compiler Error
  ```

- Template String are used to define values in multiple lines. They are defined using follow format \``${ expr }`\`
- Type assertion are like typecasting in other languages

  ```typescript
  let someValue: any = "this is a string";

  //Type casting is done in two ways using <> or as keyword
  let strLength: number = (<string>someValue).length;
  let strLength: number = (someValue as string).length; // prefered for jsx
  ```

- Different type in typescript

  | SNO | Type      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

  | 1   | number    | Used to define both integers and floating point numbers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
  | 2   | string    | Used to define character and strings                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
  | 3   | boolean   | true or false                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
  | 4   | undefined | This is a default value set to variables that are not defined or explicitly set with any value. This is also the value returned by function with void or no return values.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
  | 5   | null      | This is used to indicate value is unavailable. To determine null or undefined of a variable of function call used below console.log(null == undefined) //true console.log(null == null) //true                                                                                                                                                                                           |
  | 6   | any       | Used to store any data type. Expressions involving any are not type checked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
  | 7   | void      | This represents "nothing", can be used as a function return value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
  | 8   | never     | This is used to indicate the values that will never occur. The difference between never and void is void type can have undefined or null as a value whereas never cannot have any value. If we try to assign variable to a function with return values as never then typescript will through an error let nothing: never = null; // Error: Type 'null' is not assignable to type 'never' |
  | 9   | enum      | Defines variable that does not change. It is an easy way of giving more friendly names to sets of numeric values like { Red = 0, Blue, Green }                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
  | 10  | Array     | Store Arrays of specific datatype. There two ways of defining Arrays number[] - array of numbers Array<string> - array of strings                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
  | 11  | Tuples    | Tuples have a fixed number of elements with specific types. [boolean, string] - Tuple of boolean and a String                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
  | 12  | Function  | Must specify types for the parameters and return value (param: number) => string - Takes number as input and returns a String                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
  | 13  | object {} | Used to define variables and methods/functions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

- #### Variable Declaration:

  - There are three keyword to declare variables in Typescript `let`, `var` and `const`.

    | SNO | Keyword | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
    | --- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | 1   | var     | var declarations are accessible anywhere within their containing function, module, namespace, or global scope.                                                                                                                 |
    | 2   | let     | let declarations are lexical-scoping or block-scoping and are not visible outside of their nearest containing block or for-loop. Re-declaration of variable is not supported. A variable should be declared before it is used. |
    | 3   | const   | They are like let declarations but cannot be changed                                                                                                                                                                           |
